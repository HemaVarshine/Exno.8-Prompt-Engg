# Prompting Techniques
1.Scenario-Based Prompting
You use detailed scenarios to guide the creation of the music:  

Prompt 1: “...about college dorm life to hear while driving on the highway along the shores” – This sets a vivid scene that combines environment (driving on the highway along the shore) and theme (college dorm life).   
Prompt 2: “...to listen when a person is going through a breakup” – This targets a specific emotional situation (heartbreak) and mood (heartfelt, emotional).   

2. Genre and Style Prompting   
You specify the genre or musical style to help shape the sound:   

Prompt 1: "Tribal city pop song" – A blend of cultural and genre-based cues.   
Prompt 2: "heartfelt emotional music or instrumental" – Focus on the mood and whether it's vocal or instrumental.   

# Result:
The Prompt for the above process executed successfully
